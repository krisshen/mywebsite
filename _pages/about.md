Hey Ya! 

Welcome to my website. 

My name is **Kris Shen** and I'm a software automation test engineer, currently living in Wellington, New Zealand. (didn't even know where is this place until I got to know a friend from there many years ago ðŸ˜…) 

The purpose of this website is to mainly record/share my thoughts, status, life/work experience, projects etc.


Thanks for visiting my website, enjoy and have funðŸ˜˜
