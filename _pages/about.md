Hey Ya! 

Welcome to my website. 

My name is **Kris Shen** and I'm a software automation test engineer, currently living in Sydney, Australia. Before that I lived in Wellington, New Zealand for 4 years. (Really missing the NZ life there)

The purpose of this website is to mainly record/share my thoughts, status, life/work experience, projects etc.


Thanks for visiting my website, enjoy and have funðŸ˜˜
