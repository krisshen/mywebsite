It feels like a very very very long time since last post, year 2020 will be remembered in history for sure. Here's a short summary of what happened in the last few months.

- February - we arrived in Sydney, Australia, aiming to start our new life here. First day of my new company, people are nice and coke is FREE ;)
- March - moving into brand NEW apartment, pretty close to company office, while due to COVID-19, we started working from home since 16th March.
- April - shit things happened, due to further outbreak of COVID-19, my company's business was significantly impacted, I was asked to reduce working hours from 15th April, started self-learing at the same time.
- May - a hell of month, feeling so frustrated, couldn't figure out what to do, a bit regret of leaving New Zealand.
- June - feeling better now as our business is returned to normal, did some in-city visits, started exlporing Sydney, hope things would get recovered soon.
