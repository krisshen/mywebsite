excerpt: Am I going to Sydney?!

It's been a while since last post, I know I'm kinda lasy but this is not the only excuse because... I got a job in Sydney, I'm moving to Australia!

It took me about a month from the first day I got contacted from the company until I received my job offer couple of weeks before the Christmas holiday. 

*ToDo: will create another post for this job's details with interview process, benefits etc.*

So, that's the top priority in my head recently, in order to do this, there're tons of things I need to do:

- Selling my house - sell my house in NZ.
- Moving belongings and furniture to AU.
- Rental place - need to find a place to stay in Sydney.
- Resignation - of course I have to regisn to my current company, ANZ New Zealand, I really like working here actually.
- My Pet - I have a lovly ginger cat (her name is 啤酒), also need to take her with us by a pet transportation service
- Others

*ToDo: hmmm... another post needed here for my relocation process*

BUT, I do have concerns regarding this move, not to mention my house and job in New Zealand. 

One thing is the bushfire in Australia.

The other is coronavirus in China...
