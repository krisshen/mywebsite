## Introduction

### About This Page

This is the main page of *My Website* project.

I will write down step by step of how did I build this website from scratch and all the relevant knowledge required, all the related links will also be shared in this page. And the most important thing, how did I learn from unknown, how did I resolve all the problems during this process. I'm sure there will still be a lot to learn while building this whole website and maintaing this page.

### Inspired Video

First things first, I got inspired by this video:

### Main Parts Of My Website

In above video, it talks about how to build up and host a static website on GitHub, the most important part here is called [minimal-mistaks](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), according to its GitHub page:

Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios. As the name implies, styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you ðŸ˜„.

This website is built on top of minimal-mistakes (it's a Jekyll theme with a lot of cool features, I will go through Jekyll later). It can build a pure front end website (no server side!) with normal stuff like HTML pages, JavaScripts, Style Sheets etc. and the website content is maintained in MarkDown, this is ... great!!!ðŸ˜€ 

Apart from the website code and content setup, we also need:

- A place to host this website. In GitHub there is a feature which can host websites directly from a repository, it's called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and it's FREE.
- A custom domain to publish my website. That's why my website can be visited from [krisshen.me](https://krisshen.me) instead of a GitHub URL. But normally a custom domain needs to be purchased and it doesn't cost me much for this one... if I pick up website name wisely.
