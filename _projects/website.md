This is the main page of *My Website* project.

I will write down step by step of how did I build this website from scratch and all the relevant knowledge required, all the related links will also be shared in this page. And the most important thing, how did I learn from unknown, how did I resolve all the problems during this process. I'm sure there will still be a lot to learn while building this whole website and maintaing this page. 

First things first, I got inspired by this video:
