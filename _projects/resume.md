This is the main page of *My Resume* project.

This is a draft page and it's still under construction.
{: .notice--info}

For now I've only prepared one [single page resume](/_pages/Resume_KrisShen.docx.html).

This is a hard coded HTML page which was converted from an Office Word document.

I will do some research to find out a proper solution to make my resume alive, the basic idea is to decouple my resume in two parts:
- resume's content in Markdown
- resume's template in HTML/SASS

There're already bunch of existing implementations out there, maybe I will just need to grab one and integrate it into my website. Let's see.
